### Reinforcement Learning in Predator-Prey Ecosystem

This code demonstrates a simplified predator-prey ecosystem using reinforcement learning. The scenario involves prey (e.g., rabbits) and predators (e.g., foxes) populations. The goal is for agents to learn optimal actions ("stay" or "hunt") to maximize rewards based on the population dynamics. This report provides an overview of the code, its components, and explanations of key concepts.
