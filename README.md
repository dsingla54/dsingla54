Explore some of my favorite projects:

### Reinforcement Learning in Predator-Prey Ecosystem

This code demonstrates a simplified predator-prey ecosystem using reinforcement learning. The scenario involves prey (e.g., rabbits) and predators (e.g., foxes) populations. The goal is for agents to learn optimal actions ("stay" or "hunt") to maximize rewards based on the population dynamics. This report provides an overview of the code, its components, and explanations of key concepts.



### Accelerometer-Enhanced GPS Tracker(IoT based)

an IoT device that integrates various sensors to collect and transmit data. The device gathers temperature, touch, and accelerometer readings, along with GPS data, and sends them via a web request to a designated recipient. The program is written in Arduino language and is designed to run on compatible hardware.
